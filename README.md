# Movie List React🎬

**Movie List** is a responsive web app that allows users to browse and explore movies using the [MovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Users can view movie details, ratings, and interact with a clean interface to like or favorite their picks. The project is built using vanilla JavaScript with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for clean separation of concerns.
